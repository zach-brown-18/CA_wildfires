California wildfires between 2013-2019 burned the largest areas in the northern and central parts of the state. Wildfires also frequently occur along the coast.

Three peaks, each of a greater hight than the last, are in this plot. A peak represents a season with more area burned than the season before and after. The steep drop following each peak is owed to the decrease in available kindling the next fire season. I would like to look further back in time to see if fire seasons in California have been progressively more intense since the industrial revolution.
